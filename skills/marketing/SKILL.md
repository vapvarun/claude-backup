- You want to test before buying

**Choose Pro if:**
- You need [Pro Feature 1]
- You want [Pro Feature 2]

```

### Free vs Pro Messaging Strategy

**In Free Version:**
```php
// Subtle upgrade prompts
"🚀 Want [advanced feature]? Upgrade to Pro →"
"💡 Pro tip: Pro users can [capability] — Learn more"
"⚡ Unlock [X] more templates with Pro"
```

**Upgrade Page Copy:**
```markdown
# You've Outgrown Free. Time to Go Pro.

You've accomplished great things with [Product] Free:
- ✅ [What they've done]
- ✅ [Another achievement]
- ✅ [Growth metric]

**But you're hitting limits.** Pro removes those limits and adds:

## What You Unlock with Pro

### [Pro Feature 1]
[2-3 sentences about benefit, not just feature]

### [Pro Feature 2]
[2-3 sentences about benefit]

### [Pro Feature 3]
[2-3 sentences about benefit]

## The Math Makes Sense

[Product] Pro costs $X/year. That's less than $X/month.

If Pro helps you [achieve outcome] just once, it pays for itself.
Most users see [specific result] within [timeframe].
