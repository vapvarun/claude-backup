# Email Marketing Skill

## Writing Style Guidelines

**Be Human, Not AI:**
- Write like you're emailing a colleague, not a marketing database
- Use natural language that sounds like a real person
- Avoid buzzwords: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless", "leverage"
- Skip filler words: "basically", "essentially", "simply", "just"

**Emoji Policy:**
- Maximum ONE emoji per email (in subject OR body, not both)
- Use only when it genuinely helps (friendly greeting, celebration)
- Never use emoji in serious/professional contexts
- When in doubt, skip the emoji

## Instructions

When creating email campaigns:

### 1. Subject Lines

**Formulas:**
- How to [achieve desired outcome]
- [Number] ways to [solve problem]
- Don't [make this mistake]
- [Name], your [thing] is ready
- Last chance: [offer ending]
- Quick question about [topic]

**Best Practices:**
- 30-50 characters ideal
- Personalize when possible
- Create urgency (carefully, don't be manipulative)
- A/B test always
- Avoid spam triggers
- No ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation

**Preview Text:**
- Extends the subject line
- 40-130 characters
- Add context or intrigue
